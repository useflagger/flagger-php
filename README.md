# Flagger API SDK for PHP 

[![Build Status](https://github.com/useflagger/flagger-php/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/useflagger/flagger-php)

This library helps with integrating Flagger into PHP applications.

## Installation

This library can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require useflagger/flagger-php
```

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the Environment Token. You can get your Environment Token via the [Project settings](https://app.useflagger.com/admin/projects) in your Flagger account.

Configuration values can be set when creating a new API client or via environment variables. The environment takes precedence over values provided during the initialization process.

**Configuration via environment variables**

```bash
FLAGGER_ENVIRONMENT_TOKEN=tok-sample
```

**Configuration during initialization**

```php
use \Flagger\Client;

$client = new Client::config(['environment_token' => 'tok-sample'])->connect();
```

## Context

When retrieving values for settings a context can be provided that can change the value based on unique attributes of the context.

```php
use \Flagger\Client;
use \Flagger\Settings\Request\Entities\Context\Attribute;
use \Flagger\Settings\Request\Entities\Context\Context;
use \Flagger\Settings\Request\Entities\Context\Value;

$context = new Context('user', 'John Doe', 'john-doe', [
    new Attribute('key', [
        new Value('value'),
    ]),
]);

$client = Client::config()
    ->withContext($context)
    ->connect();

$results = $client->all();
$result = $client->get('setting-key')->getValue();

```

## Usage

Before retrieving a setting or flag, create a new client. If you configured your environment token key via environment variables there's nothing to add. Otherwise, see the example above.

```php
use \Flagger\Client;

$client = new Client();
```

### Retrieving Settings

#### All Settings

```php
$results = $client->all();

foreach ($results as $results) {
    $key = $result->key;
    $name = $result->name;
    $type = $result->type;
    $value = $result->value
}
```

#### Single Setting

```php
$result = $client->setting('setting-key');

$key = $result->key;
$name = $result->name;
$type = $result->type;
$value = $result->value
```
